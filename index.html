    <p class="para">Tiger Shroff is known as a great dancer courtesy his flexible moves in “Heropanti” and various online videos, and the actor says he wishes to open a dance school to train talent across the country.

The young actor is not a fan of various dance competition shows and thinks an institute would be a better platform for budding performers.

“I wanted to open up a dance school for everybody including the underprivileged. There’s so much talent in India that goes unnoticed,” Tiger told PTI in an interview.
